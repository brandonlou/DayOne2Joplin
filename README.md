# DayOne2Joplin

> A Python script to convert notes from the [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com/) note taking app into [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/).

## Usage

### Exporting Day One notes
1. Open Day One.
2. Select the notes you wish to transfer. Click [here](https://help.dayoneapp.com/en/articles/440668-exporting-entries) for official documentation on exporting entries. Export in `JSON` format.
3. Unzip the downloaded `.zip` file.
4. If your notes contain images, the `.zip` file will contain a directory of the same name. Rename this directory to `from_dayone`. If your notes do not contain images, there will only be a `Journal.json` file. Create a new directory named `from_dayone` and move `Journal.json` into it.
